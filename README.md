# Spell it out

A tool helping you to phonetically spell a text

## Motivation

At the behest of Friedrich Mocker I read *[Hypermedia Systems](https://hypermedia.systems/book).*

When I learn something new, I use it to build someting.
Almost mid way throught the book I had to spell out my name in German over the phone and missed a letter.

This is where the idea came to write a hypermedia driven application which spells out a string for you using the phonetic alphabet.
